## How it works

SquareDev is a combination of open source tools that makes it easy to build with LLMs. Sitting on the shoulder of giant like [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and others. [SquareDev](https://squaredev.io/) is building the tools for developers with or without AI expertise to build with LLMs.

### Components

- Studio: The UI you will be interacting with to setup your project, manage your data, get API keys and other settings.
- API: The API is the gateway to your project. It is the interface that allows you to interact with your project.
- Knowledge engine: Handles all the magic that has to do with LLMs and embeddings of Retrieval, Memory, Contextual search, text extraction and other core features.
- Monitoring: Monitors your project and provides insights on performance, latency, malicious usage and other metrics.
